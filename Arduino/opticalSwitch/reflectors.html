Overview</B></FONT></H3>

<P>An <B>infrared emitter</B> is an LED made from gallium arsenide,
which emits near-infrared energy at about 880nm. The infrared
phototransistor acts as a transistor with the base voltage determined
by the amount of light hitting the transistor. Hence it acts as a
variable current source. Greater amount of IR light cause greater
currents to flow through the collector-emitter leads. As shown in the
diagram below, the phototransistor is wired in a similar
configuration to the voltage divider. The variable current traveling
through the resistor causes a voltage drop in the pull-up resistor.
This voltage is measured as the output of the device.</P>

Applications</B></FONT></H3>

<P>One of the applications of the IR emitter and IR phototransistor
is a <B>photo-reflector. </B><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
photo-reflector is a small rectangular device that contains an
phototransistor (sensitive to infrared light) and an infrared
emitter. The amount of light reflected from the emitter into the
phototransistor yields a measurement of a surface's reflectance.The
photoreflector can be used in robot to follow a path (e.g. a white
line on the floor). </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><A NAME=infra></A>2.1 Infrared Reflectance Sensor</H4>

<P>IR reflectance sensors contain a matched infrared transmitter and
infrared receiver pair. These devices work by measuring the amount of
light that is reflected into the receiver. Because the receiver also
responds to ambient light, the device works best when well shielded
from abient light, and when the distance between the sensor and the
reflective surface is small(less than 5mm). IR reflectance sensors
are often used to detect white and black surfaces. White surfaces
generally reflect well, while black surfaces reflect poorly. One of
such applications is the line follower of a robot.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="reflect.jpg" WIDTH=215 HEIGHT=315 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=right>The
diagram on the right shows an example of a infrared reflectance
sensor. For this particular example, the IR detector being used can
be ordered from Mouser Electronics ( Part# 512-QSE113) and the IR
emitter can be ordered form Digi-Key (Part# LN175PA-ND). The
resistors being used in this example are chosen to match the
electrical properties of the IR dectector and emitter. You might want
to choose different resistors if you use different dectectors and
emitters. Different resistor values affect the sensitivity of the
infrared reflectance sensor.</P>

<P>The following is a test IC program used to illustrate how to use
the IR emitter and detector with the Handy Board. The program will
switch on a servo motor when the the IR detector receives enough
Infra-red light. The program uses the analog input 6 of the Handy
Board to read from the IR reflectance sensor. (The lower the value of
the variable <I>num</I> is, the higher the intensity of the IR
light)</P>

<PRE>void mot()
{ float period=0.0; 
  int k; servo_on(); 
  k = servo_deg(period); 
  sleep(0.1);    
} 


void main(){ 
int num; 
while(1){ 
num = analog(6); 
printf("intensity level is %d\n", num);    
if (num &lt; 100){ 
mot(); 
} 
else servo_off(); 
} 
}</PRE>

<H4><A NAME=slotted></A>2.2 IR slotted optical switch</H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">An infrared slotted optical switch is a
device similar to the photo-reflector except that the emitter is
pointed directly into the phototransistor. The slotted optical switch
can be used to build <I>shaft encoders</I>. Shaft encoders can give
the robot feedback on how far its wheels have turned or on
synchronizing two wheels' velocity. A shaft encoder usually consists
of a slotted optical switch and a striped wheel with a palette of
radically alternating holes or slots on it. The palette of stripes
will alternately reflect or not reflect light to the phototransistor,
yielding a pulse-train output. The robot can then tell how far its
wheels have rotated by counting the pulses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The wiring for the slotted optical switch is
straightforward. The white dot on the optical switch corresponds to
pin 2 in the pinout diagram and you can figure out the pins using the
pinout diagram shown above. The emitter LED is powered by te <I>Handy
Board</I>'s +5V supply, with a 330 ohm resistor in series to limit
the current through the LED to an appropriate value. In fact, there
is a pull-up resistor of 4.7K ohm built in the <I>Handy Board</I> and
it is not shown in the diagram. Different varieties of
phototransistor, however, may perform better with a smaller resistor
value than the on-board 47K resistor. If the sensitivity of the
device is poor, you can try connecting the signal line to the power
supply through another resistor to determine the best
response.</FONT></P>

Interface</B></FONT></H4>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Shaft-Encoder Pulse-Accumulator Software
Driver</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In order to use the shaft-encoder sensors in
some sort of velocity control scheme for the robot, we must first
interface the photoreflectors to the microprocessor and store the
ensuing counts for each wheel in 2 variables. One shaft encoder is
fed into the pulse accumulator on port A PA7, corresponding to the
digital input PAI/PA7 on the <I>Handy Board</I>, and the other shaft
encoder is fed into PA0, which corresponds to the digital input
TIC3/PA0 on the <I>Handy Board</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The pulse accumulator, associated with port
A pin PA7, is an 8-bit counter register and that makes it very easy
to count the number of rising or falling edges input to that pin. In
order to use the pulse accumulator, we have to initialize the pulse
accumulator control register, PACTL, properly. Details of the control
register is skipped here, and only the C code you have to write is
presented here. The following C code initializes the
pulse-accumulator system and returns the number of pulses since the
last reading.</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000">int PACTL = 0x1026 ; /*Pulse accumulator control */
int PACNT = 0x1027 ; /*Pulse accumulator control */

void init_velocity( ) /*initialize hardware for velocity monitoring */
{ poke(PACTL, 0b01010000); /* PA7 input, enable pulse acc., rising edge */
  poke(PACNT, 0); } /* Start with 0 measured velocity */

int get_left_vel( ) /* left velocity from PA7 using pulse counter */
{ int vel;
  vel = peek(PACNT);
  poke(PACNT, 0); /* reset for next call */
  return(vel); }<BR></FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
To activate the pulse-counter system, call <B>init_velocity( )</B>
during system initialization. Velocity of the left wheel can be found
by calling <B>get_left_vel ( )</B> at regular intervals. Velocity is
in units of encoder clicks per time interval (where the time interval
is the time between 2 successive calls to <B>get_left_vel( )</B>
)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Once the pulse accumulator hardware has been
initialized, it will run in the background, automatically
incrementing the count every time a stripe on the encoder wheel moves
past the photoreflector. The robot's main program does not have to
keep track of this activity but is free to attend to other sensors
and actuators. When it needs to know the encoder count, the main
program calls the function<B> get_left_vel( )</B>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Shaft-Encoder Input Capture Software
Driver</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For the encoder wheel connected to port A
pin PA0(digital input PA0), more software complexity is in store. We
must use an interrupt to count encoder clicks from the right wheel
because there is only one pulse accumulator in the 68HC11
microprocessor. We will use the IC3 register associated with PA0 to
generate an interrupt on every rising edge. The interrupt-handler
routine, which automatically runs whenever a rising edge is detected,
must increment a counter, clear the interrupt flag, and return from
the interrupt. In order to use the interrupt handler, we have to
initialize a few associated registers in a way similar to setting up
the pulse-accumulator. The following C code fragment will initialize
the associated registers properly:</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000">int TCTL2 = 0x1021; /* Timer Control 2, 8 bit reg., interrupt edge */
int TMSK1 = 0x1022; /*Timer Interrupt Masks, 8 bit reg */ 

bit_clear(TCTL2, 0b00000010); /*IC3 interrupts on rising edges */
bit_set(TCTL2, 0b00000001); /*IC3 interrupts on rising edges */
bit_set(TMSK1, 0b00000001); /* Enable only IC3 interrupts */<BR></FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
You can then insert these codes into your variable declaration
section and the subroutine that initialize the pulse-accumulator,
e.g. <B>init_velocity( )</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To write the interrupt-handler routine for
the inpuut capture register IC3, you have to write the handler in the
68HC11 assembly language.. The Interative C compiler has a means of
interfacing to assembly language routines. The following code
fragment counts the shaft-encoder pulses and stores the running sum
in a global variable <B>right_clicks</B>.</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000">TFLG1 EQU $1023 ; Timer Flag 1, 8 bit reg 
	ORG MAIN_START ; Origin for assembly module 

subroutine_initialize_module:

	rti ;return from interrupt  </FONT></PRE>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">These code fragments accomplish several
goals. A code initalizer module, <B>subroutine_initialize_module,
</B>is created, whose purpose is to store the address of the
interrupt handler in the correct location. The IC system calls this
module each time the reset button is pushed. A variable,
<B>variable_right_clicks</B>, for storing the encoder counts from the
right shaft encoder is also created (C routines will reference this
variable using the variable name <B>right_clicks</B>.) Finally,
<B>IC3_interrupt_handler</B>, an interrupt handler, is written, which
increments the right-encoder counts variable each time the reflective
photosensor sees the stripe it is looking at changes from black to
white. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To use the above assembly program with the
Handy Board, you have to copy the code fragment to the online ICB
complier at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/icb.html">http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/icb.html</A><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and then assemble it. Then, you should save the resulting icb file to
a file with an extension <B>.icb</B>. You can then download the .icb
file just like any IC files. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To complete the C program, you have to write
another subroutine to return the number of clicks from the global
variable. The following subroutine will handle this:</FONT></P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000">int get_right_vel ( ) /*right vel PA0 using interrupt */

{ int vel; 
  vel = right_clicks; 
  right_clicks = 0; /*reset for next call*/ 
  return (vel)    ; }
