	<p><em>This tutorial is for Processing version 1.1+. If you see any errors or have comments, please <a href="http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/list">let us know</a>. This tutorials is from the book, <a href="http://www.processing.org/learning/books/#reasfry2">Getting Started with Processing</a>, by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, O'Reilly / Make 2010.</em></p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>
	Start by visiting http://processing.org/download and selecting the Mac,Windows, or Linux version, depending on what machine you have. Installationon each machine is straightforward:

	<ul>
	<li>On Windows, you'll have a .zip file. Double-click it, and drag the folder insideto a location on your hard disk. It could be Program Files or simplythe desktop, but the important thing is for the processing folder to bepulled out of that .zip file. Then double-click processing.exe to start.</li>

	<li>The Mac OS X version is a disk image (.dmg) file. Drag the Processingicon to the Applications folder. If you're using someone else's machineand can't modify the Applications folder, just drag the application to thedesktop. Then double-click the Processing icon to start.</li>

	<li>The Linux version is a .tar.gz file, which should be familiar to most Linuxusers. Download the file to your home directory, then open a terminalwindow, and type:<br /><tt>tar xvfz processing-xxxx.tgz</tt><br />(Replace xxxx with the rest of the file's name, which is the versionnumber.) This will create a folder named processing-1.0 or somethingsimilar. Then change to that directory:<br /><tt>cd processing-xxxx</tt><br />
and run it:<br /><tt>./processing</tt></li>

	</ul>

	</p>
	
   	<p>
   	With any luck, the main Processing window will now be visible.Everyone's setup is different, so if the program didn't start, or you'reotherwise stuck, visit the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Troubleshooting">troubleshooting page</a> for possible solutions.
   	</p>

   	<br />
   	<em>The Processing Development Environment.</em>
   	</p>
   	
   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	
   	
   	<h3>Your First Program</h3>
   	
   	<p>You're now running the Processing Development Environment (or PDE).There's not much to it; the large area is the Text Editor, and there's a rowof buttons across the top; this is the toolbar. Below the editor is the MessageArea, and below that is the Console. The Message Area is used forone line messages, and the Console is used for more technical details.</p>

	<h5>Example 1: Draw and Ellipse</h5>
	
	<p>In the editor, type the following:</p>
	
	<p>
	<pre><span style="color: #CC6600;">ellipse</span>(50, 50, 80, 80);</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>This line of code means "draw an ellipse, with the center 50 pixels over	from the left and 50 pixels down from the top, with a width and height of	80 pixels." Click the Run button, which looks like this:</p>
	
	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-Play.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Run" /></p>
	
	<p>If you've typed everything correctly, you'll see this appear in the Display Window:</p>
	
	<p><img src="imgs/Ex_02_01.gif" width="100" height="100" /></p>
	
	<p>Ifyou didn't type it correctly, the Message Area will turn red and complainabout an error. If this happens, make sure that you've copied the examplecode exactly: the numbers should be contained within parenthesesand have commas between each of them, and the line should end with asemicolon.</p>

	<p>One of the most difficult things about getting started with programmingis that you have to be very specific about the syntax. The Processingsoftware isn't always smart enough to know what you mean, and can bequite fussy about the placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with alittle practice.</p>
	<p>Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more exciting.</p>

	<h5>Example 2-2: Make Circles</h5>
		<p>Delete the text from the last example, and try this:</p>
	
	<p><img src="imgs/Ex_02_02.gif" width="480" height="120" /></p>
	
	<p><pre>
<span style="color: #CC6600;">void</span> <span style="color: #CC6600;"><b>setup</b></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">size</span>(480, 120);
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">smooth</span>();
}

<span style="color: #CC6600;">void</span> <span style="color: #CC6600;"><b>draw</b></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">if</span> (<span style="color: #006699;">mousePressed</span>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">fill</span>(0);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">else</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">fill</span>(255);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: #CC6600;">ellipse</span>(<span style="color: #006699;">mouseX</span>, <span style="color: #006699;">mouseY</span>, 80, 80);
}
</pre></p>

	<p>This program creates a window that is 480 pixels wide and 120 pixelshigh, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse.When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. We'llexplain more about the elements of this program in detail later. For now,run the code, move the mouse, and click to experience it.</p>

	<h3>Show</h3>
	
	<p>So far we've covered only the Run button, though you've probablyguessed what the Stop button next to it does:</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-Stop.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Stop" /></p>

	<p>If you don't want to use the buttons, you can always use the Sketch menu,which reveals the shortcut Ctrl-R (or Cmd-R on the Mac) for Run. BelowRun in the Sketch menu is Present, which clears the rest of the screen topresent your sketch all by itself:</p>
   	
   	<p>
   		<img src="imgs/Menu-SketchPresent.gif" width="180" height="139" alt="Sketch menu" />
   	</p>
   	
   	<p>You can also use Present from the toolbar by holding down the Shift keyas you click the Run button.</p>

	
	<h3>Save</h3>
	
	<p>The next command that's important is Save. It's the downward arrow onthe toolbar:</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-Save.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Save" /></p>
	
	<p>You can also find it under the File menu. By default, your programs aresaved to the "sketchbook," which is a folder that collects your programsfor easy access. Clicking the Open button on the toolbar (the arrowpointing up) will bring up a list of all the sketches in your sketchbook, aswell as a list of examples that are installed with the Processing software:</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-Open.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Open" /></p>

	<p>It's always a good idea to save your sketches often. As you try differentthings, keep saving with different names, so that you can always go backto an earlier version. This is especially helpful if &mdash; no, when &mdash; somethingbreaks. You can also see where the sketch is located on the disk withShow Sketch Folder under the Sketch menu.</p>

	<p>You can also create a new sketch by pressing the New button on thetoolbar:</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-New.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="New" /></p>
	
	<p>This will replace the sketch in the current window with an empty one.Holding down Shift when you press the New button will create a newsketch in its own window, as will selecting File > New. The Open buttonworks the same way.</p>

	
	<h3>Share</h3>
	
	<p>Another theme of Processing is sharing your work. The Export button onthe toolbar:</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Menu-Export.gif" width="60" height="60" alt="Export" /></p>

	<p>will bundle your code into a single folder titled applet that can be uploadedto a web server. After exporting, the applet folder will open onyour desktop. The PDE file is the source code, the JAR file is the program,the HTML file is the web page, and the GIF file is displayed in the webbrowser while the program is loading. Double-clicking the index.html filewill launch your web browser and show your sketch on the web page it hascreated.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	
   	<p>
   	<img src="imgs/Fig_02_02.gif" width="500" height="200" alt="Applet folder" /><br />
   	<br />
   	<em>The applet folder contains the exported sketch.</em>
   	</p>
   	
   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	
   	<p>
   	<table width="600" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="20">
   	  <tr>
   	    <td>
   	  	<em>NOTE: The applet folder is erased and recreated each time you use theExport command, so be sure to move the folder elsewhere before youmake any changes to the HTML file or anything else inside.</em>
   	    </td>
   	  </tr>
   	</table>
   	</p>

	<p>You can also find Export, along with its sibling Export to Application,underneath the File menu. Export to Application creates an application foryour choice of Mac, Windows, and/or Linux. This is an easy way to makeself-contained, double-clickable versions of your projects.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	
   	<p>
   	<img src="imgs/Fig_02_03.gif" width="350" height="267" alt="Export to Application menu" /><br />
   	<br />
   	<em>Export to Application menu.</em>
   	</p>
   	
   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	
   	<p>Holding down Shift when you press the Export button on the toolbar isanother way to use Export to Application.</p>


	<h3>Examples and Reference</h3>
	
	<p>Learning how to program with Processing involves exploring lots of code:running, altering, breaking, and enhancing it until you have reshaped itinto something new. With this in mind, the Processing software downloadincludes dozens of examples that demonstrate different features of thesoftware. To open an example, select Examples from the File menu orclick the Open icon in the PDE. The examples are grouped into categoriesbased on their function, such as Form, Motion, and Image. Find an interestingtopic in the list and try an example.</p>

	<p>If you see a part of the program you're unfamiliar with that is coloredorange (this means it's a part of Processing), select its name, and thenclick on "Find in Reference" from the Help menu. You can also right-clickthe text (or Ctrl-click on a Mac) and choose Find in Reference from themenu that appears. This will open the reference for the selected codeelement in your web browser. <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/">
The reference is also available online</a>.</p>

	<p>The Processing Reference explains every code element with a descriptionand examples. The reference programs are much shorter (usually four orfive lines) and easier to follow than the longer code found in the Examplesfolder. We recommend keeping the reference open while you're readingthis book and while you're programming. It can be navigated by topicor alphabetically; sometimes it's fastest to do a text search within yourbrowser window.</p>

	<p>The reference was written with the beginner in mind; we hope that we'vemade it clear and understandable. We're grateful to the many peoplewho've spotted errors over the years and reported them. If you think youcan improve a reference entry or you find a mistake, please let us know byclicking on the link at the top of each reference page.</p>
